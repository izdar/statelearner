# StateLearner

StateLearner is a tool that can learn state machines from implementations using a black-box approach. It makes use of LearnLib for the learning specific algorithms.

This tool can be used for TLS implementations, smart cards and can be extended using its socket module. 

An overview of different security protocols where state machine learning has been applied can be found [here](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~joeri/StateMachineInference.html).

## Updated for SAE

This fork focuses on incorporating the WPA3-SAE handshake into StateLearner.
